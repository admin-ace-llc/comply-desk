     making its website and digital services accessible to people with disabilities.
   - Includes a dated “last updated” line for your policy.

   - Explains which websites, apps, and digital properties are covered.
   - Notes any third-party platforms where you have limited control.

3. Accessibility Standards &amp; Approach

     without guaranteeing legal compliance.
   - Describes your general process for testing and improving accessibility over time.

4. Reporting Accessibility Issues

        <div class="faq-grid">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this legal advice or guaranteed to be compliant?</h3>
            <p>
              No. Comply-Desk does not provide legal advice and cannot guarantee
              compliance with any law or regulation. Our kits are informational
              starting points to help you structure your own documentation. Always
              review with your internal team and external counsel if needed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What exactly do I receive after purchase?</h3>
            <p>
              You will receive: (1) a structured outline on the website and (2) an
              editable Word document (.docx) that you can download. The document
              includes placeholders and prompts where you can add your organization’s
              details, policies, and procedures.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I reuse the templates for multiple locations or clients?</h3>
            <p>
              Kits are intended for use within your own organization. If you are a
              consultant or agency creating materials for multiple clients, you are
              responsible for ensuring each output is appropriate and reviewed
              independently.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often are the kits updated?</h3>
            <p>
              Comply-Desk may update prompts, structure, or example language over
              time, but we do not commit to tracking all legal or regulatory changes.
              You remain responsible for ensuring your documentation stays current.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who should not use Comply-Desk?</h3>
            <p>
              Organizations that require formal legal opinions, highly specialized
              regulatory frameworks, or jurisdiction-specific approvals should work
              directly with qualified counsel instead of relying on templates or AI.
