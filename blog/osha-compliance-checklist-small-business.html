  <h1>OSHA compliance checklist for small businesses</h1>
  <p class="meta">Guide · approx. 6 minute read</p>
  <p>Many small businesses know they “should” be OSHA compliant but are unsure where to start. The regulations are long and technical, and it is easy to postpone documentation while you focus on daily operations.</p>
  <p>This checklist will not replace legal or specialist advice, but it can help you understand the building blocks of a basic OSHA program and where written documentation fits in.</p>

  <h2>1. Understand your main OSHA duties</h2>
  <p>Most small employers share some core responsibilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide a workplace free from recognized serious hazards.</li>
    <li>Comply with OSHA standards that apply to your operations.</li>
    <li>Inform employees about their rights and responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Record and report certain work-related injuries and illnesses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Map your hazards and high-risk activities</h2>
  <p>Start with your own work rather than the full OSHA code. Ask:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where do employees spend most of their time (warehouse, field, front-of-house, office)?</li>
    <li>What equipment, vehicles or chemicals do they use?</li>
    <li>What has gone wrong before (near misses, injuries, equipment damage)?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This helps you prioritize which procedures and documents to create first.</p>

  <h2>3. Put core safety expectations in writing</h2>
  <p>Written documentation does not have to be fancy. Many small businesses start with:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Safety policy or manual outline.</strong> A short statement about your commitment to safety, roles and responsibilities, and how hazards are addressed.</li>
    <li><strong>Workplace safety SOPs.</strong> Practical instructions for how routine tasks should be carried out safely.</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency procedures.</strong> Simple guidance on what to do in case of fire, medical incidents and severe weather.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tools like the <a href="https://www.comply-desk.com/osha-compliance-essentials-kit.html">OSHA Compliance Essentials Kit</a> and <a href="https://www.comply-desk.com/workplace-safety-sops-kit.html">Workplace Safety SOPs Kit</a> can help you generate a first draft.</p>

  <h2>4. Align training with documentation</h2>
  <p>Paperwork alone is not enough. Make sure you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walk through key expectations with new hires and supervisors.</li>
    <li>Document that training happened (sign-in sheets or digital logs).</li>
    <li>Refresh training when procedures change or incidents reveal gaps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Set up simple incident reporting and follow-up</h2>
  <p>Even in careful workplaces, things happen. A basic written process should explain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How employees report incidents and near misses.</li>
    <li>Who receives and reviews reports.</li>
    <li>How you investigate, correct and record issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Keep documents alive</h2>
  <p>OSHA documentation is not a one-time project. Review your safety manual, SOPs and emergency procedures at least annually or after major changes.</p>
  <p>If you use AI-generated kits, schedule time with supervisors or safety leads to confirm that the language reflects what actually happens in your workplace.</p>
