  <h1>What documents should every small business have on file?</h1>
  <p class="meta">Checklist · approx. 5 minute read</p>
  <p>No two small businesses are identical, but many face similar questions from employees, clients, landlords, insurers and regulators: “Do you have a safety plan?”, “Where is your handbook?”, “What is your privacy policy?”.</p>
  <p>This list is not exhaustive and is not legal advice, but it can help you see where you may want written documentation.</p>

  <h2>1. Employee handbook or core workplace policies</h2>
  <p>Even if you do not have a fancy handbook, it helps to collect your basic expectations in one place:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How hiring, onboarding and probation work.</li>
    <li>Work hours, time off and attendance expectations.</li>
    <li>Workplace conduct, anti-harassment and anti-discrimination statements.</li>
    <li>Use of company equipment, systems and information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.comply-desk.com/employee-handbook-policy-kit.html">Employee Handbook &amp; Policy Kit</a> is designed to generate a first draft you then tailor.</p>

  <h2>2. Safety program and procedures</h2>
  <p>If your team works in warehouses, on job sites or with equipment, expect questions about safety documentation, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A safety policy or manual outline aligned with your OSHA obligations.</li>
    <li>Workplace safety standard operating procedures (SOPs) for key tasks.</li>
    <li>Emergency preparedness and response procedures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Contractor and vendor expectations</h2>
  <p>Many small businesses rely heavily on contractors and vendors. Written expectations help reduce misalignment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scope of work, timelines and deliverables.</li>
    <li>Communication and reporting expectations.</li>
    <li>Basic site rules, safety expectations and confidentiality requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.comply-desk.com/contractor-onboarding-compliance-kit.html">Contractor / 1099 Compliance &amp; Onboarding Kit</a> is built for these relationships.</p>

  <h2>4. Privacy, data and website documentation</h2>
  <p>If you collect information about customers, visitors or employees, you should think about how you describe your practices. Many businesses adopt:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A privacy, data and consent policy.</li>
    <li>An accessibility or ADA statement for their website.</li>
    <li>Internal notes on where data is stored and who can access it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Where to start if this feels overwhelming</h2>
  <p>If this feels like a long list, pick one area that is causing the most friction or risk today: maybe safety for a physical operation, or a basic handbook and privacy policy for a team.</p>
  <p>AI-generated kits can shorten the time from “we should write this” to “we have a workable draft”, but they do not remove the need for judgment and review. Always make sure your documents reflect how you actually operate and comply with applicable law.</p>
